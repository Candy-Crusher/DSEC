This dataset processing code is adapted from https://github.com/uzh-rpg/DSEC, thanks for their amazing work.
Since the segmentation and flow datasets processing code remain a blank, here we complete it.
In the future, we may integrate the DSEC datasetprocessing for multiple gt to promote multi-task learning on DSEC.

**DSEC**: A Stereo Event Camera Dataset for Driving Scenarios

This is code accompanying the dataset and paper by [Mathias Gehrig](https://magehrig.github.io/), Willem Aarents, [Daniel Gehrig](https://danielgehrig18.github.io/) and [Davide Scaramuzza](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html)

Visit the [project webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/) to download the dataset.

## Install

In this repository we provide code for loading data and verifying the submission for the benchmarks. For details regarding the dataset, visit the [DSEC webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/).

1. Clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uzh-rpg/DSEC.git
```

2. Install conda environment to run example code
```bash
conda create -n dsec python=3.8
conda activate dsec
conda install -y -c anaconda numpy
conda install -y -c numba numba
conda install -y -c conda-forge h5py blosc-hdf5-plugin opencv scikit-video tqdm prettytable imageio
# only for dataset loading:
conda install -y -c pytorch pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2
# only for visualilzation in the dataset loading:
conda install -y -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

## Disparity Evaluation

We provide a [python script](scripts/check_disparity_submission.py) to ensure that the structure of the submission directory is correct.
Usage example:

```Python
python check_disparity_submission.py SUBMISSION_DIR EVAL_DISPARITY_TIMESTAMPS_DIR
```

where `EVAL_DISPARITY_TIMESTAMPS_DIR` is the path to the unzipped directory containing evaluation timestamps. It can [downloaded on the webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/dsec-datasets/download/) or directly [here](https://download.ifi.uzh.ch/rpg/DSEC/test_disparity_timestamps.zip).
`SUBMISSION_DIR` is the path to the directory containing your submission.

Follow the instructions on the [webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/disparity-submission-format/) for a detailed description of the submission format.

## Optical Flow Evaluation

We provide a [python script](scripts/check_optical_flow_submission.py) to ensure that the structure of the submission directory is correct.
Usage example:

```Python
python check_optical_flow_submission.py SUBMISSION_DIR EVAL_FLOW_TIMESTAMPS_DIR
```

where `EVAL_FLOW_TIMESTAMPS_DIR` is the path to the unzipped directory containing evaluation timestamps. It can [downloaded on the webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/dsec-datasets/download/) or directly [here](https://download.ifi.uzh.ch/rpg/DSEC/test_forward_optical_flow_timestamps.zip).
`SUBMISSION_DIR` is the path to the directory containing your submission.

Follow the instructions on the [webpage](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/optical-flow-submission-format/) for a detailed description of the submission format.
